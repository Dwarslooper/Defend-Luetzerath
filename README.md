## Contributions
We will review and help with all reasonable pull requests as long as you follow the guidelines below:

- IDE or system-related files should be added to the `.gitignore`, never committed in pull requests.
- If you change existing code, make sure it matches relatively close with the original code.
- Favour readability over compactness.
- If you add Characters, initialize them with the Character Manager and a matching class extending a Character-Type class.
- Character behaviour must only be defined in the `tick()` method of the Character's class.
- Notice that all characters extending `Enemy` will spawn automatically
